Have you ever wanted or had to manage kubernetes clusters for your organisation/business ? Cluster hosting the product ? internally used tools ?
Did any of those clusters turn into a [Developer Platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5i00z3QXyU) ? Or you wish it did ?

Here at gocy we embrace the [Platform Engineering](https://platformengineering.org/) approach and provide a template, consisting of *mostly* [CNCF](https://landscape.cncf.io/) tools, configured so that they complement each other well. Template that allows **you** te become your own cloud provider!

We test on [equinix-metal](https://deploy.equinix.com/metal/), but you can deploy it on your own infrastructure or use any other compatible [CAPI infrastructure provider](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/providers.html).  

Become your own SaaS provider! *go cloud yourself* ;)
